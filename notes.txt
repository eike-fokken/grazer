TODO: Declare all classes where it is appropriate final.

TODO: Boundaryvalue maybe should hold a matrix instead of a map. (requires testing of performance)

TODO: make subproblems inherit from nodes and define connecting problems as edges. --> Problem should hold a network of subproblems.


TODO: Maybe replace new in unique_pointer with make_unique...

TODO: replace all eigen indices by long (instead of int), requires performance testing.

TODO: Validate the json!

TODO: Think about how initial values should be handled for non-network problems!

TODO: Go back to strings in json files. DONE: topology file. Still todo: initial and boundary values.

TODO: It seems to make no difference, whether we reanalyze the pattern everytime. Check this further.

TODO: The current design of gas nodes is bad, think more about it


TODO:  Review, whether parallel execution in Networkproblem is worth it and whether it produces bugs!


TODO: make a convenient way to activate sanitizers in cmake. Check out scan-build!

TODO: create a setup.json that contains delta_x and delta_t

Note: python xq


think about providing a -march=native target


EASY Todos:

TODO: go over the tests and use the googletest framework to deduplicate code!

TODO: write getters for the data members in Isothermaleulerequations and then make them private.

TODO: refactor the print_to_files function in all gas edges into Gasedge
