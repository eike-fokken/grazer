TODO: Declare all classes where it is appropriate final.

TODO: Boundaryvalue maybe should hold a matrix instead of a map. (requires testing of performance)

TODO: make subproblems inherit from nodes and define connecting problems as edges. --> Problem should hold a network of subproblems.

TODO: replace all eigen indices by long (instead of int), requires performance testing.

TODO: Validate the json!

TODO: Think about how initial values should be handled for non-network problems!

TODO: Go back to strings in json files.


TODO:  Think about how to implement boundary conditions: In power they are distinguised by type, in gas by member enum.
Cons: not symmetric
pros: For power they are really totally different, for gas its not the defining property of a node.



TODO:  Review, whether parallel exectuion in Networkproblem is worth it and whether it produces bugs!


TODO: Try GCC ubsan to check for undefined behaviour! Also:

Clang++ -fsanitize=undefined:

Also: Check out scan-build!


Note: python xq
